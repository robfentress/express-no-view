DC Object Properties

Note: A required property must not be changed after it is initially set.

// REQUIRED: The unique ID of the DC object.
// 'id' is the only required property that must be set on every DC object, and every id must be unique.
// May consist of any type of object, including DOM elements.
// Caution: If a DOM element is used as the ID, and the element is removed or destroyed, there will be no way to retrieve the associated DC object afterwards.

var DC = $A({
  id: "UniqueId"
})[0];
